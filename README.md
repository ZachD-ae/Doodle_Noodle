# Doodle_Noodle
A daily drawing web app where users log in, receive a unique prompt, and have 30–60 seconds to doodle. After drawing, users are taken to a global gallery to view others’ creations. A pop-up lets users share or download their sketch, and each user has their own personal collection of past drawings.
